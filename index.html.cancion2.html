    <p>Look at the stars
        Look how they shine for you  <br>
        And everything you do <br> </p>
      <p> Yeah, they were all yellow <br></p> 
      <p>  I came along  <br>
        I wrote a song for you <br>
        And all the things you do <br>
        And it was called Yellow <br>
        So then I took my turn <br>
        Oh, what a thing to have done <br> </p>
       <p> And it was all yellow <br>
        Your skin, oh yeah, your skin and bones <br>
        Turn into something beautiful <br>
        And you know, you know I love you so <br>
        You know I love you so <br> </p>
       <p> I swam across <br>
        I jumped across for you <br>
        Oh, what a thing to do <br>
        'Cause you were all yellow <br> </p>
       <p> I drew a line <br>
        I drew a line for you <br>
        Oh, what a thing to do <br>
        And it was all yellow <br>
        And your skin, oh yeah, your skin and bones <br>
        Turn into something beautiful <br> </p>
       <p> And you know, for you, I'd bleed myself dry <br>
        For you, I'd bleed myself dry <br></p>
       <p> It's true <br>
        Look how they shine for you <br>
        Look how they shine for you <br>
        Look how they shine for <br>
        Look how they shine for you <br>
        Look how they shine for you <br>
        Look how they shine <br>
        Look at the stars <br>
        Look how they shine for you <br>
        And all the things that you do <br></p>
