   <h2>Letra</h2>
   <p>Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry <br>
    You don't know how lovely you are <br>
    I had to find you, tell you I need you  <br></p>
   <p>Tell you I set you apart <br>
    Tell me your secrets and ask me your questions <br>
    Oh, let's go back to the start <br>
    Running in circles, coming up tails <br>
    Heads on a science apart</p>  <br>
   <p> Nobody said it was easy <br>
    It's such a shame for us to part <br>
    Nobody said it was easy <br>
    No one ever said it would be this hard <br>
    Oh, take me back to the start</p> <br>
   <p>I was just guessing at numbers and figures <br>
    Pulling the puzzles apart <br>
    Questions of science, science and progress <br>
    Do not speak as loud as my heart</p>  <br>
   <p> But tell me you love me, come back and haunt me <br>
    Oh and I rush to the  <br>
    Running in circles, chasing our tails <br>
    Coming back as we are</p> <br>
   <p> Nobody said it was easy <br>
    Oh, it's such a shame for us to part <br>
    Nobody said it was easy <br>
    No one ever said it would be so hard <br>
    I'm going back to the start</p> <br>
