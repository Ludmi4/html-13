   <h2>Letra</h2>
   <p>Oh, they say people come, say people go <br>
    This particular diamond was extra special <br>
    And though you might be gone, and the world may not know <br>
    Still I see you, celestial</p>
    <p>Like a lion you ran, goddess you rolled <br>
    Like an eagle you circled, in perfect purple <br>
    So how come things move on? How come cars don't slow <br>
    When it feels like the end of my world? <br>
    When I should but I can't let you go? <br>
    But when I'm cold, I'm cold <br>
    When I'm cold, cold</p>
   <p> There's a light that you give me when I'm in shadow <br>
    There's a feelin' within me, an everglow <br>
    Like brothers in blood or sisters who ride <br>
    When we swore, on that night, we'd be friends 'til we die <br>
    But the changin' of winds and the way waters flow <br>
    Life is short as the fallin' of snow <br>
    And now I'm gonna miss you, I know <br>
    But when I'm cold, I'm cold</p> <br>
   <p> In water-rolled salt <br>
    And I know that you're with me, and the way you will show <br>
    And you're with me wherever I go <br>
    But you give this feelin', this everglow <br>
    Oh-ooh <br>
    Oh, what I'd give for just a moment to hold <br>
    Yeah, I live for this feelin', this everglow <br>
    So if you love someone, you should let them know <br>
    Oh, the light that you left me will everglow</p> <br>
